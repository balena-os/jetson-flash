- commits:
    - body: |-
        BalenaOS can be flashed only on SD-CARD or eMMC of the Jetson
        devices, and boot priority should reflect that. Cboot from
        the balenaOS image already switches priority to sd and emmc,
        however, during flashing this needs to be set by the tegra
        flashing tools.
        Since these tools do not automatically compile cbo.dts during
        flashing, we include it pre-compiled to avoid adding an extra
        dependency to dtc.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Jetson Nano had bootloaders and firmwares relocated
        to the qspi flash starting with L4T 32.5.1. We need
        to keep the same layout and offsets for the SD-CARD,
        and make sure all bootloaders and firmware go to
        the boot flash.
        From this commit on, only L4T 32.5.1 or newer
        can be flashed. This corresponds to BalenaOS
        v2.83.11 and newer.
