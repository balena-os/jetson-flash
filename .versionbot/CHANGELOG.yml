- commits:
    - body: |-
        BalenaOS can be flashed only on SD-CARD or eMMC of the Jetson
        devices, and boot priority should reflect that. Cboot from
        the balenaOS image already switches priority to sd and emmc,
        however, during flashing this needs to be set by the tegra
        flashing tools.
        Since these tools do not automatically compile cbo.dts during
        flashing, we include it pre-compiled to avoid adding an extra
        dependency to dtc.

- commits:

        Jetson Nano had bootloaders and firmwares relocated
        to the qspi flash starting with L4T 32.5.1. We need
        to keep the same layout and offsets for the SD-CARD,
        and make sure all bootloaders and firmware go to
        the boot flash.
        From this commit on, only L4T 32.5.1 or newer
        can be flashed. This corresponds to BalenaOS
        v2.83.11 and newer.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Padding is necessary to ensure enough space for adding
        tegra partitions in future L4T updates.
        Using a larger rootfs from the beginning ensures enough space
        for the boot blob.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Update readme file to mention tags that
        can be used with older L4T releases, like 28.x.
        BalenaOS 2.47 uses L4T 32.2, which has a
        partition layout that is incompatible with
        previous L4T releases.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Remove old GPTs from assets and let flashing
        tools construct them as specified in the partition
        xml files, just like we now do for jetson-nano and
        jetson-xavier.
        Due to the above, kernel-dtb and kernel-dtb_b partitions
        are being increased in size in this tool. This way
        resin-boot starts at the sd-card image DEVICE_SPECIFIC_SPACE
        whithout having to add another padding partition.

        The BMP blob should come from the image too,
        to prevent the BSP logo from being displayed.

- commits:
    - body: |-
        Partition offsets and sizes need to be the same,
        both when using the flash tool and when writing the
        sd-card with Etcher.
        Also, boot partition offset needs to be the same as
        the corresponding RESIN_DEVICE_SPECIFIC_SPACE,
        should sizes increase in future L4T versions.
